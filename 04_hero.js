/**
 * It's time to create a hero to dispatch these pesky monsters.
 *
 * Copy your code from the previous exercise.
 *
 * Add a SETTER method to your LivingThing class named "setHealth" that lets you update the value
 * of the "health" property.
 *
 * Now, create a NEW object called "Hero" that EXTENDS the LivingThing class.
 *
 * NOTE: Check out the following to figure out how to extend an object
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance
 *
 * Add a method to the Hero class named "attack" that takes as a parameter a LivingThing object.
 * The method should do three things:
 * 1. Reduce the LivingThing object's health by a random value between 0 and 10.
 * 2. Reduce the hero's health by a random value between 0 and 10.
 * 3. Print out how much damage the monster and hero did to each other.
 *
 * NOTE: To point you in the right direction: check out
 * the getRandomInt function on this page:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
 *
 * Give the Hero object another method named "fight" that takes as a parameter an array of LivingThing objects
 * and does the following:
 *  - For each LivingThing object in the array, call the "attack" method so the hero can attack the monster.
 *     - But, don't attack if the LivingThing is already dead!
 *  - Repeat the process until all the monsters or the hero is dead.
 *
 * Finally, you will need to instantiate your hero object with the name into a variable named "hero". Give them 100 health and a
 * name of your choice.
